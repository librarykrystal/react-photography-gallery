# Weekend React Gallery

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Description

For this weekend assignment, I created a gallery page to share photos. Visitors can click to toggle between each image and its description as well as click a button to add a "like" to any image.  Current number of likes is displayed for each.

This app was created using Node, Express, React, Postgres, Postico, and CSS styling.  React components handle looping through the data and the display of each gallery item, so more photos can be added with ease. As a stretch goal, I added SQL database functionality to replace the hardcoded array of gallery items.
